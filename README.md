This project allowed a user to pull a list of cities and temperatures from a document on their computer and then convert the temperatures from farhenheit to Celsius
Then output the new city and temperature list to a new document on the computer. 

I had a relatively easy time getting the code to read the document on the computer with the farhenheit temperatures listed for the cities. 

In order to enhance my code I would most like to add a user interface that lets the user browse the directories on the pc to find the file in question vs going strictly 
off having it named a certain way to make it more adaptable.

It took me a bit of time to be able to get the program to then output the correct information to the new document. To overcome this I had to go through and make sure that
my code was pulling information from the correct directories and in doing so I became much more proficient in reading directory paths.

The best transferable skill I learned during this project was how to import and export files which will help in the future when it is beneficial to use multiple coding languages and input sources for projects. 

To make this program maintainable and readable I tried to follow industry standards for coding and also to make sure and avoid redundant code. Keeping it succint and to the point.
